# LCP-Sim Workflow Guide

- run a simulation for all of the clashes (130 days around solstice)
- if running: check data source!
- it's not crucial to have the same time as the later analysis, since we will do a clash contour map only based on this analysis
- save save simulation
- create clash contour map: select a sourcse simulation, run mapping --> result is a clash contour file
- run a simulation with the correct data soruce, time, ... for a csv month
- save the sim
- go into stow strategy generator
- strategy mode: clash contour
- choose the clash contour map
- generate stow strategy
- 'save stow strategy to csv'
